# #0674. [Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/?tab=Description)

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest `continuous` increasing subsequence.

##### Example:
```
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
```

Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3.
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it&#39;s not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4.

#### Example:

```
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
```

Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is `[2]`, its length is `1`.

> NOTE: Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.
