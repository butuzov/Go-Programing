# #0051. [N-Queens](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/description/) 

The _n_-queens puzzle is the problem of placing _n_ queens on an _n_Ã—_n_ chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

![][1]

Given an integer _n_, return all distinct solutions to the _n_-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the _n_-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

Example:
    
    
    
    Input: 4
    Output: [
     [".Q..",  // Solution 1
      "...Q",
      "Q...",
      "..Q."],
    
     ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
      "Q...",
      "...Q",
      ".Q.."]
    ]
    Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
