# #0344. [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/description/) 

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array [in-place][1] with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters][2].

 

Example 1:
    
    
    
    Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
    Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
    

Example 2:
    
    
    
    Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
    Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
